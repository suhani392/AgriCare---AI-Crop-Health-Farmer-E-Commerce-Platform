// This file is now deprecated. 
// Sample data for products and categories is now seeded directly into Firestore for a more realistic development setup.
// See the `seedDatabase` function in `src/lib/firebase/index.ts`.

// The e-commerce products and categories are fetched from the Firestore database.
// You can manage product categories via the Admin Panel in the app.
// Products can be added/edited directly in the Firestore console.
